# invoice-server
This is a simple server that generates, displays and stores electronic receipts.

The server is run first, followed by the client GUI. After connecting to the server, a menu with commands appear. From there, the user is free to input whichever command is needed. When the receipt is created successfully, it is saved as a text file inside the project folder. As long as the receipt still exists inside the project folder, it can be loaded by the user. 

As per coursework requirements, the ReceiptClient, ReceiptServer, ReceiptStorageEngine and ServerUtils classes are modified to enable the program to function properly. ReceiptServer and ReceiptClientGUI are the main classes used to run the program. Developed using Java and NetBeans IDE.
